<div class="mission">

###Mission

I was approached by Increa Agency as they launched a call for proposals. I have to create a new brand identity for the National Observatory of Living Environments and a home page website to show the graphic possibilities. As it was all about promoting surveyors and architects, my artistic
process led me to geometric shapes to structure all the content of the page.
