###Mission

In the framework of a competition organized by Martinique’s territorial community, I did this logo redesign and won the 3 rd award. To reflect Martinique’s identity, I used the hummingbird - also known as “colibri” - which is one of the symbols of the island. If you look more closely, you can also see someone jumping high, dynamic, motivated and welcoming.
