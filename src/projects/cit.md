###Mission

For La Seine Musicale at L’Ile Seguin, we worked as a team with Sylvie Nguyen. I created a new brand identity. And we developed a digital experience to promote the launch of this new “place” dedicated to Arts which is a museum, a concert hall and a garden all at once. We imagined an interactive screen with big and short messages to attract people. Through this experience, they have to follow the guide step-by-step to learn more about the place.
